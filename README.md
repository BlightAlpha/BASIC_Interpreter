This project is to apply BASIC Programming Language syntax and semantics in conjunction with the Lexer code that transform a sequence of the 
character into token, and the parser that take the sequence of the parser and produces an abstract syntax tree created in the previous part to 
modify the feature of the language to create a Interpreter code. This project is written in python to implement the codes.
